# looker-studio-orders-dashboard

This project presents an interactive data dashboard developed to analyze and visualize order trends in a fictional retail dataset. The dashboard offers a comprehensive breakdown of order distribution across various dimensions such as region, category, segment, city, and customer activity.

The main objective of this dashboard is to help stakeholders understand where orders are concentrated and how customer behavior varies across the U.S. This enables data-driven decision-making around logistics, marketing, and inventory planning.
